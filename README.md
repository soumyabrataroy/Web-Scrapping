# A Simple web Scrapper for Stock Market
Created a simple web scrapping script (with the inspiration from the Medium Post of Justin Yek) which scraps Stock Market Data, Print it in the Jupyter Notebook and saves it locally in a CSV file.
This particular scrapper could help you to monitor your favorite stock prices on a regular basis.
